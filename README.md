# PhD Overview

As we move into the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, there is an urgent need to restore
degraded ecosystems to address the ecological and climate emergencies. Between now and 2030,
the restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded ecosystems could generate US$9 trillion in ecosystem services and remove 13â€“26 gigatons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (UNEP, 2020). Blue carbon ecosystems are particularly promising due to their exceptional capacity to sequester carbon.

However, financing has been identified as a significant barrier in the implementation of blue carbon projects. The UNEP State of Finance for Nature report found that private investment in nature-based solutions will have to triple by 2030 to close a US$4.1 trillion financing gap in nature (Mulder et al., 2021).  Currently, a key barrier for blue carbon projects securing private finance on the carbon market is the complexity and cost of quantifying and verifying carbon uptake by the system to validate carbon credits.

The aim of this PhD is to explore the potential of digital technologies and data-driven
approaches to help upscale and finance blue carbon projects. Data-driven tools will be developed to quantify and predict carbon stocks of seagrass restoration projects and alternative financing mechanisms explored.
