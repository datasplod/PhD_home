# Overview

I'm an interdisciplinary environmental data scientist researching Environmental Intelligence at the University of Exeter, UK. My research interests include:
+ blue carbon
+ natural capital 
+ earth observation data

My PhD was to explore the potential of digital technologies and data-driven approaches to help upscale and finance blue carbon projects. Data-driven tools were developed to quantify and predict carbon stocks of seagrass restoration projects and alternative financing mechanisms explored.
